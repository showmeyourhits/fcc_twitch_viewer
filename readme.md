# Twitch Memers Viewer

SPA for viewing your favorite streamers info.
Search for channels and add them to see what is up.

List of streamers will be stored in browser memory.

Delete streamers that no longer warm your heart.

### How it works?

Written using _jQuery_ and _AJAX_.


On load page checks _localStorage.following_ and if it's presented streamers info requested.
Map of stream names stored in _localStorage_ object. When user deletes last streamer object deletes from memory.


Search limited by 10 values, but user can press "More".


Simple stuff. ![Kappa](https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v1/25/1.0)
